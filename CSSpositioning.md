WHAT IS CSS POSITIONING?
CSS Positioning is simply a process of positioning your element on a webpage for the benefit of the end users..

When You first learnt about HTML, you learnt about structure and creating multiple tags..Imagine in a scenario where you have so many tags chocked up and unarranged.... That is where CSS positioning comes into play..

REAL LIFE SCENARIO
Imagine in an office where there are dozens of documents scattered all over the place left right and center.., you are so overburrddened with the arrangement process, then you start arranging them some to the left, some right and some center.

This is exactly how CSS positioning work in Web development..helps in arranging a document or series of documents(taken into consideration that everything on your webpage or website is actually regarded as documents..)
